# Note-Taker

## Description

This is a note-taking application where the user can conveniently type any kind of note or list they would like and save it for safe-keeping. When the user has completed said task or simply no longer wants the item on the list, you can click the red trash icon to delete it forever. This app was built to help the user attain the satisfaction of crossing items off a list and, additionally, keeping track of things to-do. Not only that but, in essence, the application could be used to write notes for whatever the user wants besides lists or tasks. With creating this application, I further nailed down my knowledge of creating get, post, and delete routes. Additionally, I flexed my knowledge of using midleware to accomplish tasks within the code.
